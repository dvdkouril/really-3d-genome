Hi-C (high-throughput chromatin conformation capture), a method to detect long-range chromatin interactions, allows extensive genome-wide investigation of 3D chromatin structure. However, broad application of Hi-C data have been hindered by the level of complexity in processing Hi-C data and the large size of raw sequencing data. In order to overcome these limitations, we constructed a database named 3DIV (a 3D-genome Interaction Viewer and database) that provides a list of long-range chromatin interaction partners for the queried locus with genomic and epigenomic annotations. 3DIV is the first of its kind to collect all publicly available human Hi-C data to provide 66 billion uniformly processed raw Hi-C read pairs obtained from 80 different human cell/tissue types. In contrast to other databases, 3DIV uniquely provides normalized chromatin interaction frequencies against genomic distance dependent background signals and a dynamic browsing visualization tool for the listed interactions, which could greatly advance the interpretation of chromatin interactions.

In this study, we search for CR-associated diseases potentially caused by chromosomal 3D structure alteration by integrating Hi-C and ChIP-seq data. Our algorithm rediscovers experimentally verified disease-associated CRs (polydactyly diseases) that alter gene expression by disrupting chromosome 3D structure. Interestingly, we find that intellectual disability may be a candidate disease caused by 3D chromosome structure alteration. We also develop a Web server (3Disease Browser, http://3dgb.cbi.pku.edu.cn/disease/) for integrating and visualizing disease-associated CR events and chromosomal 3D structure.},

Knowing this, many researchers are currently attempting to accurately model genome structures. Despite these increased efforts there still exists a shortage of tools dedicated to visualizing the genome. Creating a tool that can accurately visualize the genome can aid researchers by highlighting structural relationships that may not be obvious when examining the sequence information alone. Here we present a desktop application, known as GMOL, designed to effectively visualize genome structures so that researchers may better analyze genomic data. GMOL was developed based upon our multi-scale approach that allows a user to scale between six separate levels within the genome. With GMOL, a user can choose any unit at any scale and scale it up or down to visualize its structure and retrieve corresponding genome sequences. Users can also interactively manipulate and measure the whole genome structure and extract static images and machine-readable data files in PDB format from the multi-scale structure. By using GMOL researchers will be able to better understand and analyze genome structure models and the impact their structural relations have on genome activity and DNA function.},

Storage and computational costs mount sharply with data resolution when such maps are stored in dense form. Hence, there is a pressing need to develop data storage strategies that handle the full range of useful resolutions in multidimensional genomic datasets by taking advantage of their sparse nature, while supporting efficient compression and providing fast random access to facilitate development of scalable algorithms for data analysis. We developed a file format called cooler, based on a sparse data model, that can support genomically labeled matrices at any resolution. It has the flexibility to accommodate various descriptions of the data axes (genomic coordinates, tracks and bin annotations), resolutions, data density patterns and metadata. Cooler is based on HDF5 and is supported by a Python library and command line suite to create, read, inspect and manipulate cooler data collections. The format has been adopted as a standard by the NIH 4D Nucleome Consortium.Cooler is cross-platform, BSD-licensed and can be installed from the Python package index or the bioconda repository. The source code is maintained on Github at https://github.com/mirnylab/cooler.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

We reconstructed the genome structures of single diploid human cells from a lymphoblastoid cell line and from primary blood cells with high spatial resolution, locating specific single-nucleotide and copy number variations in the nucleus. The two alleles of imprinted loci and the two X chromosomes were structurally different. Cells of different types displayed statistically distinct genome structures.

This graphical tool is the first of its kind in reconstructing, storing, analyzing and annotating 3D genome models. It can reconstruct 3D genome models from Hi-C data and visualize them in real-time. This tool also allows users to overlay gene annotation, gene expression data and genome methylation data on top of 3D genome models.

	abstract = {The 3D structure of chromatin in the nucleus is important for gene expression and regulation. Chromosome conformation capture techniques, such as Hi-C, generate large amounts of data showing interaction points on the genome but these are hard to interpret using standard tools.We have developed CSynth, an interactive 3D genome browser and real-time chromatin restraint-based modeller to visualize models of any chromosome conformation capture (3C) data. Unlike other modelling systems, CSynth allows dynamic interaction with the modelling parameters to allow experimentation and effects on the model. It also allows comparison of models generated from data in different tissues/cell states and the results of third-party 3D modelling outputs. In addition, we include an option to view and manipulate these complicated structures using Virtual Reality (VR) so scientists can immerse themselves in the models for further understanding. This VR component has also proven to be a valuable teaching and a public engagement tool.CSynth is web based and available to use at csynth.org.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},
